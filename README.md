# Password-Generator

The task at hand is to create a program that generate password, given the length and charachters chosen by user. 
How the program should work:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

  Steps to write code:

// Function to prompt user for password 
  // Prompt for password length
  // At least 8 characters, no more than 128 characters
  // Conditional to check that the number that was entered is in range
  // Prompts store data as strings, so need to parse into a number
  // If the user's input is out of range, either return out of the function or call the function again

  // Confirm which character sets to use
  // If the user answers false for all, either return out of the function or call the function again
  
  // Once they select a character set:
  // Generate a random character for each selected character set
  // Either push selected character sets to a mega-array of all selected characters
  // OR you can keep the arrays separate and generate a random number to select the array and another to select the index
  
  // Once character sets are selected, move on to generating random characters


// Function for getting a random element from an array
  // Need a variable to hold the password as it's being generated
  // Need a variable to hold the index that's being generated

  // For loop that loops the number of times that matches the length the user chose
  // Generate a random number
  // That number is the index for a character in the mega-array
  // So then, mega-array[generated-index] is the actual character
  // Add that character to the password

  // Once the for loop finishes, return the generated password
